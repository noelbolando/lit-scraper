# Lit Scraper and Agno Playground #

Repo for creating a literature scraper based on Agno agentic agent use.
The Agno agent is Ollama-powered with the Minstral Model. I have descriptions, instructions, and expected output hard-coded for now. Eventually I plan to create a UI for user-input instructions. Depending on the role of the agent, the descriptions and expected output will probably stay hard-coded.

So far I have two scripts built out:
1. check_sites.py: checks websites and sends a PUSH to a discord channel
2. research_agent.py: Agno-powered research agent that fetches research articles based on a hard-coded prompt.

More work to come soon!
